## Step 1: Setting up Your Development Environment

### Download a Code Editor

A code editor is a tool that makes writing code easier, offering features like text highlighting and auto-completion. 

1. **Windows/Mac/Linux**: Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code)
2. **Installation**: Follow the installation guide for your OS (Operating System).

### Install Node.js and npm

Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code, and npm is the Node.js package manager used to install JavaScript libraries.

1. **Download**: Head to [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the installer for your Operating System.
2. **Installation**: Double-click the downloaded file and follow the installation steps.
3. **Verification**: Open a new command prompt or terminal window and run `node -v` and `npm -v` to ensure that both Node.js and npm are installed.

## Step 2: Download the Website Code ðŸ‘‡

**Option A: If You are Familiar With git**

- Open your Terminal program.
- Type the following command and press Enter:

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:ta0a2000t/casuafolio.git
  ```

**Option B: The Easier Way**

- Go to [the project GitHub page](https://github.com/ta0a2000t/casuafolio).
- Look for a button that says 'Code' and click it.
- Then click "Download ZIP".
- Once the ZIP file has downloaded, go ahead and unzip it.
  
## Step 3: Open the Project in VS Code

1. **Launch VS Code**: If not already running, open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

2. **Initiate Project Opening**: 
    - On Windows, click on `File -> Open Folder` in the menu bar at the top.
    - On Mac, click `File -> Open...`

3. **Navigate to Project Folder**: A file explorer will open. Navigate to the location where you unzipped the `casuafolio-main` folder.

4. **Select Project Folder**: Click on the `casuafolio-main` folder to select it, and then click on the "Open" button.

By following these steps, you should have successfully opened the `casuafolio-main` project folder in VS Code. 
>The top left of VSCode window should have `CASUAFOLIO-MAIN` in all caps.



## Step 4: Open Terminal in Visual Studio Code and Run Your Project

#### General Instructions

1. **Open Terminal in VSCode**: 
  - In VSCode, navigate to `Terminal > New Terminal` or `View > Terminal` from the menu to open a new terminal window.

#### Platform-Specific Instructions

**For Mac Users**

  2. **Install Dependencies**: In the terminal, type `npm install` and press `Enter`.

  3. **Run the Server**: In the terminal, type `npm start` and press `Enter`.

Certainly! Here's the revised section, now recommending the video for finding the complete path to the project folder:

**For Windows Users**

  2. **Find Project Path**: 
     - To find the complete path of your `casuafolio-main` folder, you can follow this video tutorial: [How to get the complete path to a file or folder on Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVoQhYWJuvw).
     - Make sure the path ends with `casuafolio-main`. If it doesn't, you're likely not in the correct directory.

  3. **Navigate to Project in Command Prompt**: 
     - Open the 'Command Prompt' from your computer's search window.
     - Type `cd`, add a space, and then paste the copied output. It should look like `cd C:\some\path\to\casuafolio-main`. Press `Enter`.

  4. **Install Dependencies**: 
     - In the Command Prompt, type `npm install` and press `Enter`.
  
  5. **Run the Server**: 
     - In the Command Prompt, type `npm start` and press `Enter`.

#### Final Steps for Both Platforms

  - **Open in Browser**: If a browser window doesn't automatically, open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser, like Google Chrome.


## Personalization

1. **Now that the website is up locally, you can [`Personalize The Website ðŸŽ¨`](./personalize.md).**
